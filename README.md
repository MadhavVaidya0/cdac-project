This project implements an end‑to‑end DevSecOps workflow where applications are built and deployed to a K3s Kubernetes cluster through a CI/CD pipeline, continuously monitored using Prometheus, and protected with security tools like Suricata and Falco. When a pod becomes unhealthy, Prometheus triggers Alertmanager to send real‑time email notifications, ensuring quick detection and response to failures.
